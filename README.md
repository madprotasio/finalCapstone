# Capstone Project

### What is it...
This is a compilation of projects that were meant to test my abilities.

Each one of these was it's own challenge and I am proud to present them to you.

### Description...
**Finance Calculator**

This project was made entirely from "scratch", I did get some help on it particularly with the how to make options that the user can write and the maths.

This project is a calculator that allows the user to know how much their investment is going to cost them. It has various options so the user can choose what type of investment and how they want it to be paid.
It calculates everything and displays the results in an easy to read manner. The way the options are displayed are also user friendly and easy to understand, so whoever is running it will not have a hard time navigating it.
I added some comments under each section so it is easy to understand and read the code. Overall, this project was very fun adn chalenging to make and I am very proud of it.
